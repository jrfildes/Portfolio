<h2>Unpowered Sites</h2>
<h3>$25 per car</h3>
<p>For those of you with Camper Trailers, Caravans, or even if you've just a swag but a bit of a snowflake in terms of
personal hygiene, $25 will get you a site with access to our dedicated camping toilets, shower facilities and a camp kitchen,
    with lit pathways to guide you to and from the pub at night. </p>
<h2>Powered Sites</h2>
<h3>$35 per car</h3>

<p>If you are after the authentic outback travelling experience,
    our bush camping option offers a simple site to set up your swag, tents (ground or rooftop),

    the dust and dirt a bore water shower will set you back a crisp $5 note per person.</p>
