<h1>FAQs</h1>
<p>We are happy to receive your calls and emails or messages with any and all questions whilst planning or making your trip out to us,
but suggest you have a look through our frequently asked (and answered) questions first!</p>

<h2>Do you have mobile signal?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;nmUnfortunately not. Part in parcel of being based Outback
    is the almost total disconnect from infrastructure you would take for granted in the suburbs!
    You can find our list of the nearest towns with Telstra cell signal <a href="visiting.html">here</a>.
    We do have a landline, so you can let friends or family know you are safe.
    We are also available to contact via UHF/CB on Channel 11, as you get near.</p>
<h2>Do you have Wifi?</h2>
<p>Another difficulty in being so remote is the cost and difficulty with internet access. Unfortunately we are not able to offer
use of internet for guests, as it is solely reserved for our EFTPOS machine, and work related emails. You'll have to wait until you
leave to post wonderful social media reviews of your visit!</p>
<h2>Do you have Fuel?</h2>
<p>Yes we carry both Diesel and Petrol. Generally we always keep plenty at hand,
    but if you're coming after a significant period of road closures in our area
    it is worth giving us a call to avoid disappointment!</p>
<h2>Can I bring my pet?</h2>
<p>Pets are welcome to the Corner, but we do have a few rules that you'll need to bear
    in mind should you wish to bring your fur baby along. Whilst around the estate,
    please make sure they are on a lead, and you will not be able to bring your pet to the pub/verandah area,
    or inside accommodation rooms.</p>
